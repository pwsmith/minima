I"S<p><em>So, so, many things</em>.
But, I mean things I wish I knew from a <em>techincal</em> standpoint, not just things about academia and/or life in general.
The way I handled paper writing and research in the early days of was vastly different from how I do it now.
If I had started off this way, it would have saved a lot of time in the long run.
It’s true and to be expected that everyone’s work flow evolves over time, but the basic set up one uses has a big influence on how you write, and the amount of time spent doing tasks related to that.
I think I’ve got a nice set-up now — certainly not perfect (it’s not something one can measure extensively), but it works for me — and below I share some tips that I’d give to anyone starting their PhD, especially as a linguist, but I think a lot of this holds for most disciplines.</p>
