I"¤<p>Recently I have been using reveal.js to make slides for talks, and here is a guide.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-revealjs">What is reveal.js?</h2>

<p>Reveal.js is a javascript application used for making slideshow presentations in html format.
Effectively, you are making your slides as a webpage, which means that you can style them using css, have interactive components using javascript, embed videos and audio easily, and, well, anything else you can put on a webpage.
This makes it <em>incredibly</em> flexible, and assuming you know some basic html and css, itâ€™s pretty easy to get things laid out as you need them.
Documents are written as an html file, and so all you need to write your slides is a text editor (see <a href="_posts/2019/08/25-what-I-wish-I-knew-when-starting-my-PhD.md">here</a> on thoughts about why you should use a good text editor), and the output is viewable in a web browser.
So, when you come to present, all you need is that the computer you are using has a browser, which is pretty much every computer in the world.
This has the useful effect of avoiding issues with powerpoint/keynote not being installed if you need to use a local computer.
Finally,</p>
